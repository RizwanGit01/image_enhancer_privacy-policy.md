Last updated: 10/18/2024

## Introduction

This privacy policy outlines how the Image Enhancer Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects any information when you use our extension.

## Information Collection and Use

The Image Enhancer extension is designed to enhance and manipulate images directly in your browser. We want to assure you that:

1. We do not collect any personal information.
2. We do not store or transmit your images or any data related to your image editing sessions.
3. All image processing is done locally in your browser.

## Data Storage

The extension uses temporary local storage only for the duration of your editing session. This is to ensure that your work is not lost if you accidentally close the extension or refresh the page. No data is permanently stored or transmitted to external servers.

## Third-party Services

We use Font Awesome icons loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to enhance our user interface. This CDN may collect anonymous usage data as per their own privacy policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
